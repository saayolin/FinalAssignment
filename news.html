The 5th edition of the Liberia Marathon included the infamous 10k races (including competitions for athletes in wheelchairs and on crutches), the half marathon distance and of course the master piece - the full marathon.

                          Sports have a positive impact on physical and mental health. It creates a strong sense of belonging and promotes mutual respect, fairness and tolerance. It boosts self-confidence and creates unimaginable positive energy for everyone involved.
                          But access to sports is nothing to be taken for granted. While in many parts of the world, people can sign up for sport clubs and sports events at any time, people in Liberia cannot.                          
                          The Liberia Marathon resumed its activities in November 2021 with a big 10k race â€“ the first one in six (!) years. One thousand finishers proudly crossed the finish line from all corners of Liberian society.
                         The next Liberia Marathon is planned for 2022 and will include the full-marathon distance (26.2 miles), a half-marathon (13.1 miles) and 10k races. Entrance fees will be as low as max. 5 USD to keep the race affordable and accessible for everyone.                          
                          This race is the only chance for Liberian elite runners to compete in a long-distance race and get prepared for the international arena. It is the only chance for thousands of Liberian amateur and fun runners to experience the joy of running together and the amazing individual achievement of crossing that finish line.                          
                          With an expected average cost of 40 USD per participant in order to organize a high-quality secure and safe race, your support is needed. This amount may sound high, but is actually below average for a safe, secure, and above all, professional race on global standards. Also giving the participants access to official chip-timed results, providing access to the international stage.
